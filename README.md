## Synopsis

`slacx` is designed to be a fast, lean, and modular 
x-ray data workflow interface.
Beginning with raw detector output, 
`slacx` performs calibration, 
data cleaning (cosmic ray removal),
dimensionality reduction (azimuthal integration),
peak analysis,
and ultimately packaging and shipping the data and results
to a remote filesystem or server.

## Code Example

There is no code.

## Motivation

Too many graduate students spend too many hours 
agonizing over highly repeatable operations
for x-ray data analysis.
A fast and easy-to-use software package
for this purpose is long overdue.

## Installation

There is nothing to install.

## API Reference

An API would be a really good idea.

## Tests

Tests would be a really good idea.

## Contributors

Instructions for adding modules to the workflow will go here.

## License

Currently this is a private repository.
A distribution license should be chosen before it is shared.
