The slacx software package provides 
a fast and lean platform for processing image-like data.
It is being developed to perform analysis of x-ray diffraction patterns 
for ongoing projects at SLAC/SSRL.
Some of its core features are:
\begin{itemize}
\item A plugin module for using slacx and its components in other software packages
\item An interface for users with little or no programming experience 
    to develop their own processing routines 
\item A network client for storing analysis results as structured data files 
\item A graphical user interface for users to explore analysis routines and set up workflows
\item A textual interface to perform fast batch processing based on instructions from in input file
\end{itemize}
The overarching goals of slacx are to streamline the analysis of data,
eliminate redundant development of analysis routinesg, 
and to interface with experimental equipment
to enable model-driven feedback targeting specific engineering objectives.
